   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Django Tastypie Swagger's documentation!
===================================================

Synopsis
========

**django-tastypie-swagger** is a small adapter library to construct Swagger_ documentation from Tastypie_ resources.

This package provides two things:

1. An embedded instance of `Swagger UI`_ to point a URL to.
2. Automatic `Resource Listing`_ and `API Declaration`_ generation that is consumed by #1


Usage
=====

Install package::

    pip install django-tastypie-swagger

Add to INSTALLED_APPS::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...

        'tastypie_swagger',

        ...
    ]

Enable documentation for an api endpoint by adding a URL to your urlpatterns.

eg::

  
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...

        url(r'api/myapi/doc/',
          include('tastypie_swagger.urls', namespace='myapi_tastypie_swagger'),
          kwargs={
              "tastypie_api_module":"myapp.registration.my_api",
              "namespace":"myapi_tastypie_swagger",
              "version": "0.1"}
        ),

        ...
    )

- The ``namespace`` is repeated on purpose to go around some limitations and should be unique amongst the other
urls you have defined.

- The ``tastypie_api_module`` is either your Tastypie api instance or a string containing the full path to your
Tastypie api instance.

To declare more than one endpoint, repeat the above URL definition and change the namespace.

Swagger documentation will be served up at the URL(s) you configured.

Using ``extra_actions``
-----------------------

While most **ModelResource** based endpoints are good *as-is* there are times
when adding additional functionality (`like search <http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#adding-search-functionality>`_)
is required. In Tastypie the recommended way do to this is by overriding the
``prepend_urls`` function and returning a list of urls that describe additional
endpoints. How do you make the schema map represent these endpoints so they are
properly documented?

Add an attribute to the ``Meta`` class inside your **ModelResource** class
called ``extra_actions``. Following the Tastypie search example, here is how
``extra_actions`` should be defined::

    class Meta:
        ...
        extra_actions = [
            {
                "name": "search",
                "http_method": "GET",
                "resource_type": "list",
                "summary": "Search endpoint",
                "fields": {
                    "q": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "required": True,
                        "description": "Search query terms"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]

``extra_actions`` is a list of dictionary objects that define extra endpoints
that are unavailable to introspection.

.. important::
   ``extra_actions`` feeds directly into the schema **for swagger**. It does
   not alter the Tastypie schema listing Tastypie provides.

Top level keys and meaning in the ``extra_actions`` dictionary:

- ``name``: **Required**. Nickname of the resource.
- ``http_method``: Defaults to ``"GET"``. HTTP method allowed here as a string.
  Will be uppercased on output.
- ``resource_type``: If this is declared as ``"list"`` then the endpoint
  **will not** include a ``{id}`` parameter in the uri or in the parameters
  list. This is applicable to endpoints such as the above example that filter
  or perform actions across many items. If ``resource_type`` is omitted and
  the ``http_method`` is ``"GET"`` then the endpoint will default to ``"view"``
  and include a ``{id}`` parameter in the uri and parameter list.
- ``summary``: Description of this endpoint.
- ``fields``: **Optional** Dictionary of parameters this endpoint accepts.
- ``responseClass``: **Optional** Should match the id of the corresponding model
- ``model``: **Optional** Dictionary of parameters describing the model. ``type`` and ``description`` are the two required elements.  ``required`` is optional and is False by default.
Example ::

	'responseClass': 'blog-class',
	'model':{
		'id': "blog-class",
		"properties": {
			"title": {
				"type": "string",
				"description": "This is the title. Max 80 caracters."
				"required":True
			},
			"content": {
				"type": "text",
				"description": "Content of your post. Text up to 65000+"
				"required":True
			}
		}
	}

Field dictionaries are declared in a ``{ "name": { [options dict] }`` style.
This is done for compatibility reasons with older versions of
django-tastypie-swagger.

.. warning::
   The structure of ``fields`` will likely change in future versions if
   `Joshua Kehn`_ continues committing.

Available keys and meaning for the ``fields`` dictionary:

- ``type``: Defaults to ``"string"``. Parameter type.
- ``required``: Defaults to ``False``.
- ``description``: Defaults to ``""`` (empty string). Description of this
  parameter.


Detecting required fields
-------------------------

Tastypie 0.9.11 **ModelResource** fields do not respect the *blank* attribute on django model fields, which this library depends on to determine if a field is required or not.

You can use `this ModelResource subclass <https://gist.github.com/4041352>`_ as a workaround to this issue.


Using plural names for resources
--------------------------------

It is possible to define a *plural* name for a resource, using this attribute in the class' ``Meta``:

    class ShoeResource(Resource):
        size = ...
        brand = ...

        class Meta:
            resource_name = 'shoe'
            resource_name_plural = 'shoes'
